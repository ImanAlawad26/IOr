    <h1>Code. Coffee. Chaos. â€“ My Dev Life Unfiltered â˜•ðŸ’»ðŸ§ </h1>

    <p>
  I didnâ€™t start coding because I wanted to become a developer I started because I was curious. 
    Curious how apps worked, how websites remembered things, how games responded like they knew me. 
    Over time, the curiosity turned into late nights, bug hunts, and that weird joy of finally getting something to run without errors. 
    Now, coding feels like a quiet superpower. I may not wear a cape, but with a keyboard and a bit of logic, 
    I can build things that live in the digital world  and thatâ€™s pretty close to magic
